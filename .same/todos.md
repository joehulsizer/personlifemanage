## ü§ñ CONTINUATION PROMPT FOR NEW CHAT SESSION

**Context**: You are continuing development of a Personal Life Manager app built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, Supabase, and shadcn/ui. The project has a solid foundation with authentication, database, and basic category pages, but we've been systematically transforming each page from basic functionality into comprehensive, polished experiences.

**What We've Accomplished**: 
- Dashboard navigation cards are fully functional
- Diary page is completely transformed with full editing, mood tracking, calendar, and streak calculation
- Notes page has full markdown editing, templates, search, and CRUD operations  
- Shopping page has advanced list management, supplement tracking, and filtering
- Tasks page has comprehensive filtering and management features

**Current Methodology**:
1. **Choose a page** that still needs transformation (Work, School, Social, Meetings, or Projects)
2. **Analyze thoroughly** - Read the current page implementation and identify ALL non-functional buttons, placeholder content, missing features, and opportunities for enhancement
3. **Separate concerns** - Create server component for data fetching and client component for interactions, following the pattern used in diary/notes/shopping pages
4. **Implement comprehensively** - Don't just fix individual buttons, transform the entire page into an amazing, fully-functional experience with:
   - Full CRUD operations with proper modals/forms
   - Real-time search and filtering capabilities  
   - Multiple view modes (grid/list when applicable)
   - Proper loading states and error handling
   - Intuitive user interactions and feedback
   - Stats/analytics overview sections
   - Quick actions and bulk operations where relevant

**Your Task**: 
1. First, analyze the codebase to understand the current state
2. Choose the next page to transform (suggest Work, School, Social, Meetings, or Projects)
3. Examine that page thoroughly and identify all functionality gaps
4. Create a comprehensive transformation plan
5. Implement the complete transformation, ensuring the page becomes as polished and functional as the diary, notes, and shopping pages

**Key Principles**:
- Always ensure complete functionality over partial fixes
- Follow the established patterns for server/client component separation
- Focus on user experience and intuitive interactions
- Implement real-time updates and proper state management
- Add comprehensive error handling and loading states
- Make every button, input, and interaction fully functional

**Files to Focus On**: Look at `src/app/dashboard/[page]/page.tsx` and corresponding component files in `src/components/[category]/` for the page you choose to transform.

Continue the amazing work of making this Personal Life Manager the best productivity app possible! üöÄ
