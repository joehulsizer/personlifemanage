**Context**: You are continuing development of a Personal Life Manager app built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, Supabase, and shadcn/ui. The project now has **7 out of 9 pages completely transformed** into enterprise-grade, fully functional experiences!

**What We've Accomplished**: 
- ‚úÖ **Dashboard** - Fully functional navigation cards and overview

**Still Need Transformation**:
- üîÑ **Meetings Page** - Basic foundation, needs professional meeting management
- üîÑ **Projects Page** - Basic foundation, needs advanced project management with kanban

**Proven Transformation Methodology**:
1. **Deep Analysis** - Identify ALL non-functional buttons and missing features (typically 15-20+ issues per page)
2. **Server/Client Separation** - Create server component for data fetching, client component for interactions
3. **Complete Feature Implementation** - Transform every button into working functionality with:
   - Full CRUD operations with professional modals/forms
   - Real-time search and advanced filtering
   - Multiple view modes (Overview, List, Calendar, Analytics, etc.)
   - Progress tracking and visual analytics
   - Comprehensive error handling and loading states
   - Professional UI with responsive design
4. **Enterprise Features** - Add time tracking, progress monitoring, bulk operations, export features

**Your Mission**: Choose one of the remaining 2 pages (Meetings or Projects) and transform it from a basic foundation into an incredible, fully-functional experience that matches the quality of our completed pages.

**Key Standards to Maintain**:
- Every button must be functional (no placeholder buttons)
- Full CRUD operations for all data types
- Real-time search and filtering
- Multiple view modes for different use cases
- Professional UI/UX with intuitive interactions
- Comprehensive modals for data entry/editing
- Progress tracking and analytics where applicable
- Responsive design working on all devices

**Files Pattern**: 
- Server: `src/app/dashboard/[page]/page.tsx` (data fetching)
- Client: `src/components/[page]/[page]-page-content.tsx` (interactions)

Transform another page into an amazing productivity powerhouse! The momentum is incredible - we're 78% done with full page transformations! üöÄ
